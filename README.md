# BOSS Summit - Silent Payment Wallet Workshop

## What is Silent Payments?

Silent Payments (BIP352) is a revolutionary Bitcoin protocol that enables receiving private payments from anyone using a single static address without requiring any interaction or extra on-chain overhead. Unlike traditional Bitcoin transactions that require communication between sender and receiver or leave privacy-compromising metadata, silent payments use static addresses that cannot be linked to actual payments on-chain.

**Key Features:**
- **Privacy by Default**: Transactions appear indistinguishable from regular Bitcoin transactions
- **No Address Reuse**: Every payment generates a unique on-chain address automatically
- **Static Payment Address**: Share one address, receive infinite payments privately
- **No Interaction Required**: Senders don't need to communicate with receivers
- **3 Tier Wallet Design**: Replaces traditional xpub/xpriv separation with Scan, Spend Keys, and Address components.

The protocol leverages elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) for key derivation, requiring recipients to scan the blockchain for payments. While scanning adds computational overhead, the privacy and usability benefits make it a game-changer for Bitcoin privacy.

## What We're Building

In this workshop, we'll demonstrate a **production-ready Silent Payment wallet** built on React Native, featuring:

- ‚úÖ Full BIP352 implementation
- ‚úÖ Mobile-first architecture (iOS & Android)
- ‚úÖ Efficient blockchain scanning with indexer integration
- ‚úÖ Real-time payment detection
- ‚úÖ Transaction history and UTXO management
- ‚úÖ Wallet Birth height optimization for faster syncing

## Workshop Flow

### Part 1: Live Demonstration (30 minutes)

**What we'll do:**

1. **Create a Fresh Wallet** üÜï
   - Generate a new Silent Payment wallet live on stage
   - Show the Silent Payment address (sp1...)
   - Explain the address format and structure

2. **Fund the Wallet** üí∏
   - Send Bitcoin to the wallet's silent payment address from a test wallet
   - Broadcast the transaction on testnet/signet
   - Wait for confirmation

3. **Detect the Payment** üîç
   - Watch as the wallet scans and detects the incoming payment
   - Show real-time scanning progress
   - Display the detected UTXO with transaction details

4. **Make Seed Public** üîì
   - Reveal the mnemonic seed phrase to everyone
   - Display it on the big screen
   - Share via QR code

### Part 2: Interactive Challenge (45 minutes)

TODO: update challenge

**The Challenge: First Come, First Served!** üèÜ

Once the seed is public, participants will:

1. **Download the Wallet App**
   - iOS: TestFlight link (TODO: provide link)
   - Android: APK download link (TODO: provide link)

2. **Import the Wallet**
   - Use the shared seed phrase
   - Let it sync and detect the UTXOs

3. **Race to Withdraw!**
   - First person to successfully sweep the funds wins
   - Learn about:
     - Wallet import/recovery
     - UTXO scanning
     - Transaction creation
     - Fee management
     - Race conditions in Bitcoin

**Learning Objectives:**
- Hands-on experience with Silent Payment wallet recovery
- Understanding blockchain scanning requirements
- Real-world transaction broadcasting
- Dealing with concurrent spends and UTXO conflicts

## Workshop Prerequisites
